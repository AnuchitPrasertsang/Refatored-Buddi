Buddi
</h1>

<p>
Buddi is a personal finance and budgeting program, aimed at those who have little or no financial background.  In making this software, I have attempted to make things as simple as possible, while still retaining enough functions to satisfy most home users.
</p>
<p>
Buddi will run on almost any computer which has a Java virtual machine installed.  This can include Windows, Macintosh OS X, Linux, and many more operating systems.  One thing to note is that you must have Java 1.5 or later installed.  If you are running on Macintosh OS X 10.4 (Tiger), you should have this installed.  If you are running on a different operating system, like Windows, please consult the help files.  If you need to download a copy of the Java VM, you can do so from <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp'>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Buddi is currently available in English, and there are plans for Spanish and Russian translations in the near future.  If you are interested in translating to another language, feel free to do so!  I would greatly appreciate it if you also sent me the translated file once you are finished.  For more details, please see the <a href='./developers.php'>developers</a> page.

This basically means that you can use it for free, as long as you don't try to charge other people for it.  Since you have access to the source code (it is included with every package that you can download), you have the ability to modify the program if you want it to work a little differently.

If you decide to use this software, I would love to hear from you!
