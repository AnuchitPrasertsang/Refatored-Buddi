<h1>Backup and Restore</h1>

<p>
It is recommended to backup your data file regularly.  To backup, simply select 'Backup Data File' from the File menu.  To load, you can either copy over the existing data file with a backup (make sure that Buddi is closed before you do this), or select 'Open Data File' from the File menu.  (Note that if you open the data file, it will change the default location to that of the backup file).
</p>

<p>
By default, Buddi remembers the location of the last data file which was used.  If you want to change to a different data file, you can do so via the 'Open Data File' menu command.
