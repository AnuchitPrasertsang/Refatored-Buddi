<h1>Backup and Restore</h1>

<p>
Starting with version 0.95 Beta, Buddi will automatically create a new backup file every day when you first launch the program.
</p>

<p>
To restore a previous backup, you can select 'Restore from Backup File' from the File menu.  This will overwrite your existing file with the contents of the selected backup file.  It is recommended that you make a backup copy of your data file beforehand.
</p>

<p>
In version 0.95, you can also create a new data store, as well as load an existing one.
