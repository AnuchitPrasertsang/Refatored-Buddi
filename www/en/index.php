Buddi
</h1>

<p>
Buddi is a personal finance and budgeting program, aimed at those who have little or no financial background.  In making this software, I have attempted to make things as simple as possible, while still retaining enough functions to satisfy most home users.
</p>
<p>
Buddi is released as Open Source Software.  You can download it for free, with no disabled features and no time limit.  If you find that you like it, and that it has helped you to organize your finances, I would greatly appreciate a small donation via the link at the bottom of the page.  I have spent thousands of hours of my own time perfecting Buddi - while I am not doing this for the money, I do need to support myself and my family, and every little bit helps!
