<h1>Backup and Restore</h1>

<p>
As of version 1.8.0, Buddi will automatically keep a rolling backup of the most recently used data files.  You can change the number of files to keep in the Preferences.
</p>

<p>
To restore a previous backup, you can select 'Restore from Backup File' from the File menu.  This will overwrite your existing file with the contents of the selected backup file.  It is recommended that you make a copy of your data file beforehand.
</p>

<p>
Buddi also supports having more than one data file.  You can create new files, or load existing ones, from the File menu.  Buddi automatically remembers the last one you had open at startup.
