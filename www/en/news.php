<h2>This page is out of date!</h2>
<p>
As you have no doubt noticed, this page is rather outdated.  This is not due (entirely) to my laziness; instead, I have been too busy updating other documents to remember to update this as well.  Your best bet to find current news is to view the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/news/?group_id=167026'>Buddi News listing</a> on the Sourceforge.net page.  Not only is it more up-to-date, it also has <a href='http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_project.php?group_id=167026'>RSS feeds</a>!
