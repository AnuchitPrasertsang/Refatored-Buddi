<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>How do I run the program?</h2>

<p>
That depends on what operating system you are running.  If you are in Windows, simply double click on the Buddi.jar file.  If you are on a Macintosh, double click on the Buddi application bundle.  If you are on Linux or some other platform where the association of .jar to the Java VM has not been set up, type 'java -jar Buddi.jar' on the command line.
</p>

<h2>Why doesn't this stupid program work?</h2>

<p>
You need to have Java 1.5 installed for Buddi to work. If you are running OS X, you need to have Tiger installed and the Java 1.5 update installed. If you are running on a different platform, please consult the documentation for that system.

<h2>What's up with your stupid version numbers!</h2>

<p>
I use a versioning scheme similar to the Linux kernels: X.Y.Z, where X is the major release, Y is the minor version, and Z is the bugfix number.  Even minor versions (0, 2, 4...) are considered stable, while odd minor numbers are considered unstable, or at least development.  For instance the first stable version is 1.0.0; the first bugfix will be 1.0.1, etc.  At the time of release, the code branched into two: the 1.0 branch, which will receive no new features, but will continue to benefit from bugfixes, and the 1.1 line, which will continue with major development.  Once it is considered complete, it will become 1.2.0, the next stable version, and so on.
