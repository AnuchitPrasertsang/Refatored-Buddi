<h1>Developer Information</h1>

<p>
If you are interested in adding to my project in any way, please do so!  The source is can be downloaded freely from <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddi'>http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddi</a>.  I use Eclipse with the EMF plugin for editing and compilation.  If you load the unpacked source into a new Eclipse project, everything should work just fine.
</p>

<p>
As of version 1.9.2, you can write four kinds of plugins: import, export, report, and graph.  For more information on this, please see the <a href='plugins.php'>Plugins</a> page.
