<h1>Budget Categories</h1>

<p>
Budget categories are where money comes from, or goes to.  When you first start the program, there are a number of preset categories; these can be modified to better suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
With each of these categories, you can enter the amount which you think you will spend (or, in the case of income categories, receive).  This will be used in reports and graphs to show you how well you kept to your budget.  As well, it can help in your monthly planning to ensure that you don't spend more money than you recieve.  The Budgeted Net Income / Month, shown at the bottom of My Budget screen, shows the difference between the budgeted income and expenses.
</p>

<p>
There are two types of categories: Income and Expense.  Income categories would include such things as your salary, interest earned, gifts recieved, etc.  Expense categories are anything that you spend money on, such as groceries, fuel, etc.
</p>

<p>
Just like <a href='./accounts.php'>accounts</a>, you can add new categories by clicking on the 'New' button, or edit existing categories with the 'Edit' button.
</p>

<p>
If you set the Parent Category, you can create sub categories:

After you have created a sub category, it shows underneath its parent:
