<h1>Reports and Graphs</h1>

<p>
Buddi includes a strong reporting system, which helps users monitor (and hopefully tame) their spending habits.  The reports are pretty much self explanatory: you get to select a report and timeframe, and the results will pop up in a new window.  As with all other windows, you can choose to print these for your own records.
</p>

<p>
Some of the graphs and reports include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Textual breakdown of income and expenses, compared with the budget estimates</li>
<li>Pie charts of expenses and income, over a given time period</li>
<li>Breakdown of net worth, and changes in net worth over time</li>
</ul>

<p>
If there is a report type which you think would be nice to have, feel free to <a href='&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#119;&#121;&#097;&#116;&#116;&#046;&#111;&#108;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;'>suggest</a> it to me.
