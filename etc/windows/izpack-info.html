<h1>Buddi</h1>

<p>
Buddi is a personal finance and budgeting program, aimed at those who have little or no financial background. In making this software, I have attempted to make things as simple as possible, while still retaining enough functions to satisfy most home users.
</p>

<p>
I created Buddi because I wanted a simple to use budgeting software which does not require a degree in accounting to use.  All software which I previously tried to use seemed either too complex or did not have the features which I wanted.
</p><p>
Buddi is my attempt to remedy this problem.  It is written in Java (Java 1.5 required), so it can run on most operating systems.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, focusing on the user's budget, and helping the user keep that budget through the use of reports.
</p><p>
Buddi is Open Source software, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).  For full text of this license, please see the Licenses document, included with this installation.  Basically, the GNU GPL says that you are free to use the program, share it, change it, and do just about anything you want with it as long as you keep this notice and keep the derivative works licensed under the GPL as well.

If you like this software, please consider donating via the link on the main Buddi home page (http://buddi.thecave.homeunix.org).  I develop, support, and maintain Buddi in my spare time, and greatly appreciate all support that I recieve.  Donations have helped me buy new hardware for testing, as well as helping me and my family financially, allowing me to spend more time working on Buddi.
