Plugins Readme

The plugins provided here are (mostly) not created by me.  They have been
submitted by third parties, and are not supported by me.  I keep them in the
main source tree to ensure that changes I make don't break the plugins;
in that case, I will try to fix them, but I can make no guarantees.  I
have done cursory testing of these plugins, but I am not responsible for 
them.  If they break and hose your entire system, don't blame me!

If you want to compile them for yourself, run the bundlePlugins script from
the local directory, after having loaded the entire project in Eclipse.
(You will have to be on a *NIX box for this; if you are on Windows, you 
will have to either get Cygwin or convert my script to a Windows batch 
file).  The jar'ed plugins will show up in the Plugins directory, after
which you can copy them wherever you want to, and load them in Buddi.

If you have problems with a particular plugin, your best bet is to contact
the plugin author.  I can try to help you too, but my abilities are limited.

Cheers
