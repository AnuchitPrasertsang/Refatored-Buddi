Installation Instructions:

Macintosh OS X:
Drag the Buddi.app file into /Applications.

Windows:
Run the downloaded Buddi-<version>.exe.  The installer will prompt you for
an installation location.  The installer will also associate Buddi files
with Buddi, and set up a start menu icon.

Debian / Ubuntu:
Double click on the Buddi.deb file.  When prompted, install the package.
Alternatively, you can install from the command line with the command
'sudo dpkg -i Buddi-X.deb' (where X is the version of the file)

Generic Unix:
Copy 'buddi' and 'Buddi.jar' to /usr/bin (or some other location in
your path).  Modify the buddi script to reflect the location you chose.
