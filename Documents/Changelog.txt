1.0.0 (June 23 2006)
-Official stable version
-Finalized German translation

1.0.0 RC5 (June 20 2006)
-Added grayed out description fields to empty fields (<Description>, etc)
-Fixed transactions window to allow smaller window sizes without cutting portions off
-Fixed problem when recording without all fields, the fields already entered were deleted
-Fixed translation problems
-Added the total for expense / income on pie graph title
-Changed to not show categories in certain graphs that don't have any activity for this time period.

1.0.0 RC 4 (June 19 2006)
-Made the amount field larger in the transaction edit pane.
-Sometimes the cents get rounded down, probably due to double rounding errors.  Replaced the JNumberField with a DecimalField class modified from http://rangiroa.essi.fr/cours/turorial%20java/uiswing/components/textfield.html.  I moved the double -> long conversion to this class, as well.
-Maximum value for decimalField was about 200,000.00, due to int overflow errors; this is fixed, and it is now in the hundred trillions.
-Changed order of fields on the transactions list screen.  Now it is different from the editable transaction pane, but it seems to flow better.
-Added German translation (many thanks to Torsten Hinsche).

-Misc. changes to file layout structure, to prepare for translations.  Put all help documentation (both on the website and offline) under a subfolder matchine the language name (e.g., Help/en/index.html).
-Change to the preferences file structure.  Buddi will automatically create a new file, but you will lose your preferences (such as data file location, language, screen positions, etc).  It's all OK; don't panic.

-Added printing to all windows: Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Graphs, and Reports

-Should be stable enough for everday use, although if there are changes to the data format in the future, you may have to convert the data file.
