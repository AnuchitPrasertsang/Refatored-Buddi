0.91 Beta (May 26 2006)
-Interim bugfix release, to fix display problem introduced with 0.9.  Windows (and possibly all non-Macintosh Java VMs) did not like the TreeCellRenderer that I included in 0.9, and the accounts and categories lists would not display.

-Added printing to all windows: Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Graphs, and Reports
-Completed online help documentation (http://buddi.sourceforge.net)
-Many minor improvements to UI

0.8 Beta (May 24 2006) - First public release.
-Includes ability to edit accounts, categories, and budget amounts
-Can show reports and graphs on net worth, expenses, etc.
-Should be stable enough for everday use, although if there are changes to the data format in the future, you may have to convert the data file.
