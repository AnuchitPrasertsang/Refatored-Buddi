1.7.1
-Added Spanish translation

1.7.0 (Sept 5 2006)
-New development branch.  1.7.0 Development is the same as 1.6.0 Stable.

1.6.0 (Sept 5 2006)
-Stable release incorporating the 1.5.x development.  The biggest changes since 1.4 are in the preferences window, especially the localization options.  The currency symbol is now separate from the language file, which helps reduce the number of localizations I need to include.  Also, I changed the display format for the Transactions window, which should make for fewer bugs when long strings are entered.  For complete details of differences between 1.4 and 1.6, please see the 1.5 changelog.

1.6.0rc2 (August 31 2006)
-Updated the EMF libraries to 2.2.1 build 20060824
-Reorganized package structure to better reflect the MVC architecture.  This should help third party developers to better interface with Buddi, as it is much clearer now what is the model, etc.

1.6.0rc1 (August 27 2006)
-Updated Norwegian translation
-First release cantidate for stable version 1.6

1.5.4 (August 22 2006)
-Reworked the list in the Transaction window.  It now has some intelligence to know where to chop off lines to avoid overflow, but still show as much as the window size allows.  To the testers: please ensure that this works on all platforms, at all screen resolutions, etc, and give me any feedback.  If this works well, I may do a similar thing for the Reports window.

1.5.3 (August 21 2006)
-Added Interest Rate and Credit Limit to accounts.  Interest Rate is only for your records - it does not calculate interest or anything, and only shows up if you select it in Preferences.  If you enter a Credit Limit, you can see in the Transactions Window how much credit you have left.
-Improved Preferences user interface.
-Fixed additional minor problem with JDecimalField.
-Removed CURRENCY_SYMBOL from the language file, and moved it to preferences.  This lets you choose currency independent of the language settings.

1.5.2 (August 19 2006)
-The bug fixed earlier today caused another minor one - if you don't type the entire value, e.g. instead of $12.30 you type $12.3, Buddi interprets it as $1.23.  This should now be fixed.
-Added en-IN to languages

1.5.1 (August 19 2006)
-Fixed bug related to Double rounding when reading from JDecimalField.  Now JDecimalField parses the long value directly, instead of converting to double first.

1.5.0 (August 17 2006)
-New development branch.  1.5.0 Development is the same as 1.4.0 Stable.

1.4.0 (August 17 2006)
-First stable version to include scheduled transactions and HTML export

1.4.0rc3 (August 16 2006)
-Fixed a number of bugs found in the Scheduled Transactions window

1.4.0rc2 (August 16 2006)
-Added Autocomplete as an option

1.4.0rc1 (August 15 2006)
-Code cleanup
-Norwegian Translation update
-Data format change notification

1.3.4 (August 15 2006)
-Fixed a null pointer exception relating to updating transaction window
-Improved style of report export to HTML, and fixed bug with it

1.3.3 (August 14 2006)
-Added Scheduled Transactions.  This lets you set up recurring transactions, so that you don't have to repeatedly enter them.  There are some limitations in the current implementation: you can only choose between frequencies of Month and Week, and you can only choose one day for the transactions to occur.  For instance, you can set the transaction to occur every Monday or the 4th day of every month, but you cannot set it for Monday and Wednesday of every week, or every second month, etc.
-When you record a transaction, Buddi will now update all other transaction windows which are open.  This will reduce the possibility of seeing out of data information in the transactions windows.
-Removed help from distribution, instead relying on the web page.  This makes the distro smaller, and ensures that all help is current.  If anyone has any comments on this (or would prefer to have it included), let me know.

1.3.2 (August 10 2006)
-Added Quarter and Year to budget intervals
-Added This Quarter and Last Quarter to report intervals
-Added HTML Export options as an alternative to printing (for reports).  This gives you a more customizable, better looking output.
-Update to Norwegian translation

-Added Norwegian translation (thanks to Gudbrand Hegge)
-Fixed incorrect translation key
-Updated some items in en-US localization

1.0.0 RC 4 (June 19 2006)
-Made the amount field larger in the transaction edit pane.
-Sometimes the cents get rounded down, probably due to double rounding errors.  Replaced the JNumberField with a DecimalField class modified from http://rangiroa.essi.fr/cours/turorial%20java/uiswing/components/textfield.html.  I moved the double -> long conversion to this class, as well.
-Maximum value for decimalField was about 200,000.00, due to int overflow errors; this is fixed, and it is now in the hundred trillions.
-Changed order of fields on the transactions list screen.  Now it is different from the editable transaction pane, but it seems to flow better.
-Added German translation (many thanks to Torsten Hinsche).

-Change to the preferences file structure.  Buddi will automatically create a new file, but you will lose your preferences (such as data file location, language, screen positions, etc).  It's all OK; don't panic.

0.9 Beta (May 25 2006)
-Added printing to all windows: Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Graphs, and Reports
-Completed online help documentation (http://buddi.sourceforge.net)
