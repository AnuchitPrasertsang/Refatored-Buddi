0.8 Beta

First public release.

Includes ability to edit accounts, categories, and budget amounts.  Can show
reports and graphs on net worth, expenses, etc.  Should be stable enough for 
everday use, although I recommend not using it for critical data yet, as if 
there are changes to the data structure in the future, you may lose data.
