2.3.2
-Complete overhaul of GUI framework.
	-Corrected MVC architecture.
		-Moved all GUI classes to the view package
		-Added static controller classes for specialized data access
		-Removed all superfluous methods from DataInstance - now it is just the model access layer, with no controller components
	-This should allow for improved speed and features in future releases, as it has cleaned up the code base substantially.
-Added thread based Preloader for TransactionsFrames.  This loads all the windows at first, to speed up access later on.
-Complete overhaul of reports / graphs.  Now these are shown in the web browser, and not in Buddi windows at all.
-Complete overhaul of printing.  Now longer using Java printing.  All print requests go to a web browser with HTML.

2.3.1 (March 22 2007)
-Added Search to language editor
-Added Not Reconciled and Not Cleared to the filters on the transaction window
-Added an option to show the currency sign before or after the amount (for some European currencies)
-Updated Norwegian translation
-Added an optional message to scheduled transactions.  These are now called 'Scheduled Actions', as you can do more than just schedule transactions to be run.  Any message which you specify will be shown on the scheduled day (or the first program execution after that day); this can therefore be used for reminders on bills, credit card payments, etc.

2.3.0 (March 2 2007)
-Unstable branch of 2.2.0 Stable.

2.2.0 (March 2 2007)
-Improved display of Accounts and Budget Categories
-Addition of a much improved Scheduled Transactions dialog (thanks to NCSU students Nicky and Abhik for their help with this)
-Misc. GUI improvements and tweaks

2.1.13 (February 15 2007)
-Fixed bug which could potentially corrupt data files
-Fixed bug which did not allow loading of plugins on Windows
-Added Javadocs to all methods in DataInstance, to better help plugin developers
-Fixed GUI bug where dialogs for creating / editing Accounts and Categories had large gap if there existed Accounts / Categories with very long names
-Added method to TransactionFrame to allow adding multiple transactions at once.  This should avoid the need to update the window multiple times for simple imports.

2.1.12 (February 10 2007)
-Final (?) revision on the Transaction window layout.  I feel that this new design is much easier to read, and does not display as much information (I removed the Number field, in addition to the Memo field removed earlier).  Many thanks to Rosanne for suggesting new layouts, working off my suggestions, etc.
-Fixed bug 1653640, where extra characters show in the documents accessed via Help menu.  Thanks to JST for pointing out where the bug was.

2.1.11 (February 8 2007)
-Fixed a problem with the HTML export on Windows
-Corrected the highlight color of text
-Changed the layout of cells in the Transaction window, to (hopefully) make the values more clear

2.1.10 (Feburuary 6 2007)
-Fixed a display bug where budget categories deeper than 3 or 4 would not show.  Now the tree display column width is dynamically calculated, based on tree depth.
-Updated BrowserLauncher to 1.0 version
-Changed the Transaction window to have different columns for Debits and Credits (Request #1649969)
-Misc. UI improvements (including Request #1649970, #1649972, #1651137)

2.1.9 (February 1 2007)
-Fixed a bug which would reset the creation date of an account when you modify the name / starting balance.  This would then result in the account not being properly used in net worth and other time senstive graphs.
-Fixed the Date Format in Transactions Window bug
-Added a workaround for the bug which only shows 3 levels of Budget categories.  Currently the width is increased to allow users to see about 5 levels; in a future release, I will add logic to automatically expand as needed.

2.1.8 (January 25 2007)
-Added option to open a new file in the event that you don't have read / write permission to the default data file
-Added Bi-Weekly schedule option
-Added shortcuts for transaction editing
-Added option of offline help
-Added Ctrl+W shortcut to close windows on Non Mac systems (this was already present on the Macintosh)

2.1.7 (January 22 2007)
-Added new Norsk.lang to reflect new additions to Buddi
-Fixed bug which prevented manual file backup
-Added custom currency input.
-Added option to prompt for data file at program startup (useful if multiple users are using Buddi on the same account)

2.1.6 (January 5 2007)
-Fixed another bug which prevents new data files from being created.

2.1.5 (January 4 2007)
-Fixed bug which could result in data loss, if you did not have write permissions to the data file
-Added Portuguese and Russian translations
-Added title bar text to report / graph windows
-Fixed bug which only showed the name of the account in the Transactions title bar, instead of the name and account type.

2.1.4 (December 17 2006)
-Fixed bug when loading existing scheduled transactions
-Fixed bug which cut off text from Actual / Budgeted graph

2.1.3 (December 7 2006)
-Added the Scheduled Transactions NCSU project, with some GUI / code cleanup changes.  Now there are 7 frequency options: Monthly by Date (every month on a particular date, e.g. 1st), Monthly by Day of Week (every month on the first, e.g., Saturday of the month), Weekly (every week on, e.g., Wednesday), Every Day, Every Weekday, Multiple weeks every month, and Multiple Months every year.  This should cover most people's needs; if there are some that I have missed, the code is now clean enough that it would not be too difficult to add more.

2.1.2 (November 30 2006)
-Added dialog to add / rename Account Types (look under Advanced Options)

2.1.1 (November 10 2006)
-Converted the JTable in Account and Categories listing to JXTreeTable to give columns.

2.1.0 (November 4 2006)
-Unstable branch of 2.0.0 Stable.

2.0.0 (November 4 2006)
Since 1.8.0:
-Rewrote the display code for the Transactions window, which results in massive speedups
-Finalized and enhanced Plugin architecture
-Improved translation architecture, to make it much easier for localizations and initial translations
-Added color-coded language editor, to help people make translations (available via Preferences -> Advanced -> Edit Languages)
-Now the program is one single file; all documenation, languages, etc are within the .jar / .exe / .app.
-Improved the ability of running from a flash drive.  When setting up the shortcut, just specify the -p option, and give a relative path to the preferences file in the same directory as Buddi executable - the rest is automatic

Since 2.0.0rc5:
-Fixed translation bug for Scheduled Transactions
-Removed some un-needed dialogs from showing at startup (such as Created new Data File notice, and Upgrade notice if this is the first time they ran the program)

2.0.0rc5 (November 3 2006)
-Set default directory for opening files and creating new files to be the same directory that the current one is in.
-At startup / plugin reload, if there is a bad plugin (plugin which throws an exception while loading, usually due to .jar file being moved / deleted), we remove the plugin entry from the Preferences file.

2.0.0rc4 (November 1 2006)
-Updated English and Norsk languages
-Added data file path to title bar
-Added ability for plugin authors to include their own translations.  These are loaded in the same manner as regular translations, from the root of the Plugin.jar file.

2.0.0rc3 (October 30 2006)
-Fixed bug which prevented plugins from being loaded from .jar on Windows
-Fixed bug in install scripts which did not include Buddi.png
-Added French language
-Updated German language

2.0.0rc2 (October 24 2006)
-Fixed Null Pointer Exception bug when running from source (the Documents / Licenses could not load from jar, for obvous reasons).  When running from the binary version, there is no problems.
-Added labels to the different Language editor text areas, to better define which panel is linked to which data.

2.0.0rc1 (October 20 2006)
-Updated comments and documentation on most major classes
-Changed the build script to remove need for keeping Buddi_OSX_Folder.  I now build the .app from scratch.
-Moved the documentation and licenses into the .jar file.

1.9.5 (October 18 2006)
-Fixed bug which prevented Buddi from starting on Windows, due to error in the working directory regex.

1.9.4 (October 14 2006)
-Improved Language Editor, and integrated it into Preferences.  You now edit language directly from preferences, and it saves it automatically to the apropriate Languages directory.

1.9.3 (October 12 2006)
-Added a Language Editor to Buddi.  Can be invoked by running 'java -jar Buddi.jar --editor'.  (This may be moved separately later, but it is tiny (only one Java file, containing 2 main classes), and I think this is simpler for everyone)
-Tweaked translation loading so that English is loaded as a 'base' language, and the other languages are applied afterwards, replacing any duplicate keys.  This has the advantages of a) making it easier to make English localizations (you only have to specify the keys which are different), b) makes my life easier, since I only have to add new strings to one file, and c) makes language editors lives easier, as they can use the Language Editor and have it point out differences between English and their language.
-Working (unsuccessfully so far) on integrating RetroWeaver with the build process, to allow Java 1.4 binary compatibility.

1.9.2 (October 9 2006)
-Added Plugins to the preferences screen.  Now they load at runtime without modifying Classpath.
-Cleaned up plugin code extensively
-Split out many common components into Moss library (http://moss.sourceforge.net)
-Added better support for USB keychains.  If you save files (including Data files and Plugins) within the working directory, Buddi automatically removes the leading path element.  This allows the files to be easily portable to other paths (different letter mounts of USB drives on different machines, for instance) with little or no problems.
-Added Dutch translations

1.9.1 (October 6 2006)
-Considerable speed-up on transactions (after the first load, it is almost instantaneous, compared with a number of seconds before on my machine)
-Fixed add / remove / update behaviour, and improved upon it from the Stable version (items stay selected when they should, lists scroll properly, etc).
-Fixed the filters (date and search string).  Added a cool new search widget instead of the clunky button to clear the search from before (based on Elliot's NSSearchField style widget at http://elliotth.blogspot.com/2004/09/cocoa-like-search-field-for-java.html)
-Added nicer looking highlighting and striping to transactions window

1.9.0 (Sept 30 2006)
-New development branch.  1.9.0 Development is the same as 1.8.0 Stable.

1.8.0 (Sept 30 2006)
-The addition of a built in, transparent encryption scheme for Buddi data files
-A pluggable reporting system, which allows third party developers to add custom report types
-A Windows-specific distribution package, which includes a single .exe file.  This has the advantage over the previous .jar of showing the proper icon in the toolbar, running under the process name 'buddi' instead of 'javaw', etc.
-The bundling of Language files into the executable, helping prevent problems related to an incorrect working directory
-Rotating backup files, instead of relying on users to delete old backups
-Numerous UI improvements, such as:
--Reports and graphs being automatically updated whenever the data changes
--The removal of the Mac-specific LNF and logic from the Windows / Generic bundles.  This allows for a more native design, as well as a smaller file size
--The ability to specify a specific java LNF at startup, via the --lnf command line option
--General UI cleanup, with a special focus on ease of use

1.8.0rc2 (Sept 26 2006)
-Fixed bug where, if you updated (as opposed to recoreded) in transactions window, the selected transaction would change to the new item.  It now keeps the edited transaction selected.
-Updated Norwegian language

1.8.0rc1 (Sept 24 2006)
-Fixed bug when switching from old language to new
-Added rotating backup - instead of making a new backup file every time, and relying on the user to delete old ones, there are now X number of backup files, denoted by Data.X.buddi (where X is a number between 0 and NUMBER_OF_BACKUPS).  Each time you start, the backup files are shuffled up (Data.0.buddi becomes Data.1.buddi), and the current data file is copied to Data.0.buddi.  You can set the number of backup files in Preferences.
-Update reports / graphs when something changes.
-Simplified Preferences screen by separating each panel into its own tab.
-ScheduledTransactions now sorted according to name
-Code Cleanup (renamed ScheduledTransaction objects to comply with naming convention)

1.7.8 (Sept 23 2006)
-Moved languages to inside the .jar / .exe file.  This makes is possible to move the .jar anywhere you want, without any additional supporting files.  If you want to use a custom language file, just include it in the Languages directory, and it will override the built in one.
-Updated Norwegian language
-Updated the EMF libraries
-Cleaned up the makefile and workspace.  It is now much simpler (hopefully) to build the files.
-Included ant script to compile and make fat jar.  You need to point the build.xml file to your installed fat jar Eclipse plugin.

1.7.7 (Sept 20 2006)
-Added a native .exe file for Windows users.  This makes things much easier - you can copy the entire Buddi folder to Program Files, and then link a shortcut to it, without worrying about boring things like 'Start In' directories.  I still do not have an installer for Windows, and will probably not ever have one (unless someone adamently thinks this is aGood Thing (tm), and wants to create an automated process to make that).  Coming from a Mac / Unix perspective, installers are useless, especially since I don't use the registry at all.
-Changed language file names to be more user friendly - English instead of en.
-Misc. GUI fixes for Windows
-Updated BrowserLauncher library to BrowserLauncher2, which should increase support for Linux

1.7.6 (September 18 2006)
-Added Export to CSV for all transactions / transactions within a frame (depending on where you export from)
-Added Date Filter to transactions window, to limit visible transactions to specific date range (thanks to John Didion for the original patch for this feature)

1.7.5 (September 15 2006)
-Re-did the report / graph architecture.  Now Buddi includes the ability for third parties to create custom reports and graphs.  To do this, implement org.homeunix.drummer.plugins.Buddi{Graph|Report}Plugin, include your compiled classes on the class path, and reference them all in a comma separated list after the --plugins command line option.  For instance, '--plugins com.example.Report1,com.example.Graph2' (without the quotes, of course).  If I have enough interest in this, I will change this to be included in the Preferences file, so that end users don't need to mess with command line options.
-Tweaked some layout parameters for non Mac OSX systems to look better on Linux / Windows.

1.7.4 (September 14 2006)
-Cleaned up the UI quite a bit.  This was done for two main reasons: make the UI less cluttered looking, and speed up GUI operations.  The second objective has been met (at least a little; profiling shows a speed increase of about 10%).  Whether or not the GUI looks better is up for debate - if you feel strongly one way or another, please let me know.
-I am now using a newer version of FatJar, which removes unused classes.  This makese the downloads even smaller - about 3 MB for Mac, and 2 MB for Linux / Windows.

1.7.3 (September 13 2006)
-Added encryption of data files (thanks to John Didion for creating the actual cipher and associated logic).  This lets you encrypt the data file with strong encryption without relying on the OS to do this for you.
-Added Overdraft limit for debit accounts (comparable to credit limit)
-Fixed a bug which did not disable Edit, Delete, and Open buttons after editing / adding / opening an account.
-Did some more work on Preferences to make the options more clear
-You can now change languages without having to manually restart the program

1.7.2 (September 10 2006)
-Fixed bug which would not let To / From fields display all items when too many categories were included.  Now scrollbars are added.
-Some speed improvements when rendering large numbers of transactions; still room for improvement, though.
-Added icon to window frame (Thanks to John Didion for this patch)
-Added option to select a custom look and feel from the command line.  (Thanks to John Didion for this patch)  Please run java -jar Buddi.jar --help for more syntax.

1.7.1 (September 7 2006)
-Added Spanish translation
-Added Cleared and Reconciled checkboxes to transactions.  Please let me know all feedback about these features.  Note: Before using them you need to first enable them in the Preferences screen, under 'Show Advanced'.

1.7.0 (September 5 2006)
-New development branch.  1.7.0 Development is the same as 1.6.0 Stable.

1.6.0 (September 5 2006)
-Stable release incorporating the 1.5.x development.  The biggest changes since 1.4 are in the preferences window, especially the localization options.  The currency symbol is now separate from the language file, which helps reduce the number of localizations I need to include.  Also, I changed the display format for the Transactions window, which should make for fewer bugs when long strings are entered.  For complete details of differences between 1.4 and 1.6, please see the 1.5 changelog.

1.6.0rc2 (August 31 2006)
-Updated the EMF libraries to 2.2.1 build 20060824
-Reorganized package structure to better reflect the MVC architecture.  This should help third party developers to better interface with Buddi, as it is much clearer now what is the model, etc.

1.6.0rc1 (August 27 2006)
-Updated Norwegian translation
-First release cantidate for stable version 1.6

1.5.4 (August 22 2006)
-Reworked the list in the Transaction window.  It now has some intelligence to know where to chop off lines to avoid overflow, but still show as much as the window size allows.  To the testers: please ensure that this works on all platforms, at all screen resolutions, etc, and give me any feedback.  If this works well, I may do a similar thing for the Reports window.

1.5.3 (August 21 2006)
-Added Interest Rate and Credit Limit to accounts.  Interest Rate is only for your records - it does not calculate interest or anything, and only shows up if you select it in Preferences.  If you enter a Credit Limit, you can see in the Transactions Window how much credit you have left.
-Improved Preferences user interface.
-Fixed additional minor problem with JDecimalField.
-Removed CURRENCY_SYMBOL from the language file, and moved it to preferences.  This lets you choose currency independent of the language settings.

1.5.2 (August 19 2006)
-The bug fixed earlier today caused another minor one - if you don't type the entire value, e.g. instead of $12.30 you type $12.3, Buddi interprets it as $1.23.  This should now be fixed.
-Added en-IN to languages

1.5.1 (August 19 2006)
-Fixed bug related to Double rounding when reading from JDecimalField.  Now JDecimalField parses the long value directly, instead of converting to double first.

1.5.0 (August 17 2006)
-New development branch.  1.5.0 Development is the same as 1.4.0 Stable.

1.4.0 (August 17 2006)
-First stable version to include scheduled transactions and HTML export

1.4.0rc3 (August 16 2006)
-Fixed a number of bugs found in the Scheduled Transactions window

1.4.0rc2 (August 16 2006)
-Added Autocomplete as an option

1.4.0rc1 (August 15 2006)
-Code cleanup
-Norwegian Translation update
-Data format change notification

1.3.4 (August 15 2006)
-Fixed a null pointer exception relating to updating transaction window
-Improved style of report export to HTML, and fixed bug with it

1.3.3 (August 14 2006)
-Added Scheduled Transactions.  This lets you set up recurring transactions, so that you don't have to repeatedly enter them.  There are some limitations in the current implementation: you can only choose between frequencies of Month and Week, and you can only choose one day for the transactions to occur.  For instance, you can set the transaction to occur every Monday or the 4th day of every month, but you cannot set it for Monday and Wednesday of every week, or every second month, etc.
-When you record a transaction, Buddi will now update all other transaction windows which are open.  This will reduce the possibility of seeing out of data information in the transactions windows.
-Removed help from distribution, instead relying on the web page.  This makes the distro smaller, and ensures that all help is current.  If anyone has any comments on this (or would prefer to have it included), let me know.

1.3.2 (August 10 2006)
-Added Quarter and Year to budget intervals
-Added This Quarter and Last Quarter to report intervals
-Added HTML Export options as an alternative to printing (for reports).  This gives you a more customizable, better looking output.
-Update to Norwegian translation

1.3.1 (August 8 2006)
-Added Norwegian translation (thanks to Gudbrand Hegge)
-Fixed incorrect translation key
-Updated some items in en-US localization
-Upgraded to EMF 2.2 (used in conjunction with Eclipse 3.2)

1.3.0 (August 6 2006)
-New development branch.  1.3.0 Development is the same as 1.2.0 Stable.

-Added new report type (Income / Expense by Description)
-Fixed some UI bugs

1.1.4 (July 17 2006)
-Added ability to turn on / off account sorting by type
-Added update notification - when a new version is released, Buddi will look for it at startup; this can be disabled through the preferences
-Moved source code to SourceForge's SVN servers

1.1.3 (July 13 2006)
-Accounts are sorted by type, with rollups available for categories. 

1.1.2 (July 12 2006)
-Added search to transactions
-Misc. bugfixes

1.1.1 (July 7 2006)
-Reports show what transactions contribute to the value
-Reports allow 'hyperlinking' to individual transactions

1.0.1 (July 7 2006)
-Moved EMF jars to source, for better use of source code

1.1.0 (June 27 2006)
-Moved EMF jars to source, for better use of source code
-Automatically completes transaction number, memo, to and from based on description
-Change of preferences file to support new features; data file format still the same.  Preferences can be upgraded automatically from previous versions, but previous versions will not recognize the new format; if you care about preferences, backup the original file before running the new version.

1.0.0 (June 23 2006)
-Official stable version
-Finalized German translation

1.0.0 RC5 (June 20 2006)
-Added grayed out description fields to empty fields (<Description>, etc)
-Fixed transactions window to allow smaller window sizes without cutting portions off
-Fixed problem when recording without all fields, the fields already entered were deleted
-Fixed translation problems
-Added the total for expense / income on pie graph title
-Changed to not show categories in certain graphs that don't have any activity for this time period.

1.0.0 RC 4 (June 19 2006)
-Made the amount field larger in the transaction edit pane.
-Sometimes the cents get rounded down, probably due to double rounding errors.  Replaced the JNumberField with a DecimalField class modified from http://rangiroa.essi.fr/cours/turorial%20java/uiswing/components/textfield.html.  I moved the double -> long conversion to this class, as well.
-Maximum value for decimalField was about 200,000.00, due to int overflow errors; this is fixed, and it is now in the hundred trillions.
-Changed order of fields on the transactions list screen.  Now it is different from the editable transaction pane, but it seems to flow better.
-Added German translation (many thanks to Torsten Hinsche).

1.0.0 RC 3 (June 8 2006)
-The third release cantidate for 1.0 stable.  Please report any bugs that you may find to wyatt.olson@gmail.com
-Fixed reports screen if there was many categories (scroll bar did not work before)
-Misc. UI improvements

1.0.0 RC 2 (June 6 2006)

-Misc. UI improvements

1.0.0 RC 1 (June 4 2006)
-The first release cantidate for 1.0 stable.  Please report any bugs that you may find to wyatt.olson@gmail.com
-Warn if you have unsaved changes to a transaction, and you click on another one
-Changed the transaction edit screen's format to be (hopefully) layed out in a more logical manner.
-Misc. UI improvements
-Misc. changes to file layout structure, to prepare for translations.  Put all help documentation (both on the website and offline) under a subfolder matchine the language name (e.g., Help/en/index.html).
-Change to the preferences file structure.  Buddi will automatically create a new file, but you will lose your preferences (such as data file location, language, screen positions, etc).  It's all OK; don't panic.

0.95 Beta (May 30 2006)
-Added local help documents
-Each window remembers size / screen position on close
-Misc. UI improvements
-Automatically creates a backup file each day on the first run of the day.
-Added menu options to create a new data store and restore from a previous backup.

0.91 Beta (May 26 2006)
-Interim bugfix release, to fix display problem introduced with 0.9.  Windows (and possibly all non-Macintosh Java VMs) did not like the TreeCellRenderer that I included in 0.9, and the accounts and categories lists would not display.

0.9 Beta (May 25 2006)
-Added printing to all windows: Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Graphs, and Reports
-Completed online help documentation (http://buddi.sourceforge.net)
-Many minor improvements to UI

0.8 Beta (May 24 2006) - First public release.
-Includes ability to edit accounts, categories, and budget amounts
-Can show reports and graphs on net worth, expenses, etc.
-Should be stable enough for everday use, although if there are changes to the data format in the future, you may have to convert the data file.
