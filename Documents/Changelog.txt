1.0.0 RC 1 (June 4 2006)
-The first release cantidate for 1.0 stable.  Please report any bugs that you may find to wyatt.olson@gmail.com
-Warn if you have unsaved changes to a transaction, and you click on another one
-Changed the transaction edit screen's format to be (hopefully) layed out in a more logical manner.
-Misc. UI improvements
-Misc. changes to file layout structure, to prepare for translations.  Put all help documentation (both on the website and offline) under a subfolder matchine the language name (e.g., Help/en/index.html).
-Change to the preferences file structure.  Buddi will automatically create a new file, but you will lose your preferences (such as data file location, language, screen positions, etc).  It's all OK; don't panic.

-Added menu options to create a new data store and restore from a previous backup.

0.91 Beta (May 26 2006)
-Interim bugfix release, to fix display problem introduced with 0.9.  Windows (and possibly all non-Macintosh Java VMs) did not like the TreeCellRenderer that I included in 0.9, and the accounts and categories lists would not display.

0.9 Beta (May 25 2006)
-Added printing to all windows: Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Graphs, and Reports
-Completed online help documentation (http://buddi.sourceforge.net)
-Many minor improvements to UI

0.8 Beta (May 24 2006) - First public release.
-Includes ability to edit accounts, categories, and budget amounts
-Can show reports and graphs on net worth, expenses, etc.
-Should be stable enough for everday use, although if there are changes to the data format in the future, you may have to convert the data file.
