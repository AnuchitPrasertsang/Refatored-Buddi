Suggested Standard Formatting:

Accounts:
//Note: Account balances reflect net worth.  If a credit account it negative, the net worth is positive.
//Credit account / TypeTotal Names should show up Red; Debit should show as Black, regardless of totals
//Account / TypeTotal Balance Amounts should display based on the following table:
Debit >= 0: Black
Debit < 0: Red, Negative

Credit <= 0: Red
Credit > 0: Black, Negative

Categories:
//Categories are all shown as positive, regardless of income.  We therefore have to use special logic for the expense ones.
//Expense Category names should show up Red; Income as Black, regardless of totals
//Category Budgeted Amounts should show up based on the table below:
Income >= 0: Black
Income < 0: Red, Negative 

Expense >= 0: Red
Expense < 0: Black, Negative 

Transactions:
//All transaction text (non-numerical) should be black
//Balances should show according to the rules for accounts above, based on which account the given transaction window is open for.
//Transfer Amounts should display as follows:
Amount+ <= This Account: Red, Positive, Left Column
Amount- <= This Account: Black, Negative, Left Column
Amount+ => This Account: Black, Positive, Right Column 
Amount- => This Account: Red, Negative, Right Column

//If there is no associated account (i.e., for some reports), Transaction values should display as follows:
//From	To	+/-	Color
A	A	+	Black
A	A	-	Red
A	C	+	Red
A	C	-	Black
C	A	+	Black
C	A	-	Red

Simplified, this is equivalent to If "To == Category && Value >= 0" or "To == Account && Value < 0" then value is Red.


Totals:
//Generic account totals should always be expressed as a Debit account.  The only exception to this is TypeTotal when the type is credit; in this case, they should be shown as a Credit account
