I created Buddi because I wanted a simple to use budgeting software 
which does not require a degree in accounting to use.  All software 
which I previously tried to use seemed either too complex or did not 
have the features which I wanted.

Buddi is my attempt to remedy this problem.  It is written in Java 
(Java 1.5 required), so it can run on most operating systems.  I have 
tried to keep it as simple as possible, focusing on the user's budget, 
and helping keep that budget through the use of reports.

Buddi's core functions include:
1) Setting up accounts and expense / income categories, and recording 
   transactions between them.
2) Setting up a budget, and tracking how well the budget is being kept.
3) Showing various reports and graphs. 

Buddi is Open Source software, and is released under the GNU General 
Public License (GNU GPL).  For full text of this license, please see the 
document in the Licenses directory.  Basically, this means that you are 
free to use it, share it, and do just about anything you want with it 
other than selling it.  If you want to help support future developments,
feel free to donate using the link on the main Buddi homepage.

To run the program, either double click on the .jar file (Windows), 
double click on the Buddi application file (Macintosh), or type from a 
command line (in the Buddi directory) 'java -jar Buddi.jar' (just about 
any other operating system).  Although Buddi runs on most major operating 
systems, like most programs it looks much nicer when running on a Macintosh.

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, 
please see the online help documentation, at http://buddi.sourceforge.net.

For bug reports, suggestions, or just to let me know that you are using 
the program, please email me.

Cheers!
