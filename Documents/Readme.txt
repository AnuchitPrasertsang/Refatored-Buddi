I created Buddi because I wanted a simple to use budgeting software which does not require a degree in accounting to use.  All software which I previously tried to use seemed either too complex or did not do what I wanted.

Buddi is my attempt to remedy this problem.  It is written in Java (Java 1.5 required), so it can run on most operating systems.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, focusing on three main functions:

Buddi's core functions include:
1) Setting up accounts and expense / income categories, and recording transactions between them.
2) Setting up a budget, and tracking how well the budget is being kept.
3) Showing various reports and graphs. 

It runs on most major operating systems, but (like most programs), it looks much nicer when running on a Macintosh.

To run the program, either double click on the .jar file (Windows), double click on the Buddi application file (Macintosh), or type from a command line (in the Buddi directory) 'java -jar Buddi.jar' (just about anything else).

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, please see the online help documentation, at http://buddi.sourceforge.net.

For bug reports, suggestions, or just to let me know that you are using the program, please email me.
