Buddi is personal finance / budget software, intended for use by those without
much accounting experience.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, 
without compromising functionality.

Buddi's core functions include:
1) Setting up accounts and expense / income categories, and recording 
   transactions between them.
2) Setting up a budget, and tracking how well the budget is being kept.
3) Showing various reports and graphs. 

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, please
see the help file documentation.

For bug reports, suggestions, or just to say hi, please email me.

Cheers
