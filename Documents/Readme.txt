Buddi is personal finance / budget software, intended for use by those without much accounting experience.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, without compromising essential functionality.

Buddi's core functions include:
1) Setting up accounts and expense / income categories, and recording transactions between them.
2) Setting up a budget, and tracking how well the budget is being kept.
3) Showing various reports and graphs. 

It runs on most major operating systems, but (like most programs), it looks much nicer when running on a Macintosh.

To run the program, either double click on the .jar file (Windows), double click on the Buddi application file (Macintosh), or type from a command line (in the Buddi directory) 'java -jar Buddi.jar' (just about anything else).

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, please see the online help documentation, at http://buddi.sourceforge.net.

For bug reports, suggestions, or just to let me know that you are using the program, please email me.

Cheers
