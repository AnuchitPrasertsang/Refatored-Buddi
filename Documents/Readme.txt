----------------------------------------

I created Buddi because I wanted a simple to use budgeting software which does not require a degree in accounting to use.  All software which I previously tried to use seemed either too complex or did not have the features which I wanted.

Buddi is my attempt to remedy this problem.  It is written in Java (Java 1.5 required), so it can run on most operating systems.  I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, focusing on the user's budget, and helping the user keep that budget through the use of reports.

Buddi's core functions include:
1) Setting up accounts and expense / income categories, and recording transactions between them.
2) Setting up a budget, and tracking how well the budget is being kept.
3) Showing various reports and graphs. 

Buddi is Open Source software, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).  For full text of this license, please see the Licenses document.  Basically, this means that you are free to use it, share it, change it, and do just about anything you want with it as long as you keep this notice and keep the derivative works licensed under the GPL as well.

If you like this software, please consider donating via the link on the main Buddi homepage (http://buddi.sourceforge.net).  I develop, support, and maintain Buddi in my spare time, and greatly appreciate all support that I recieve.  Donations can help me buy new hardware for testing, as well as helping me and my family financially, allowing me to spend more time working on Buddi.

To run the program, either double click on the .exe file (Windows), double click on the Buddi application file (Macintosh), or type from a command line (in the Buddi directory) 'java -jar Buddi.jar' (just about any other operating system).

For more information on how to use Buddi to help with your finances, please see the online help documentation, at http://buddi.sourceforge.net.

For bug reports and feature requests, please use the designated form on the website.  If you wish to contact me directly, feel free to email me; however, if you do have a bug report or enhancement request, please use the web site as directed - you will have a much better chance of having your suggestion implemented, as I use the trackers on SourceForge for task organization.

Cheers!
