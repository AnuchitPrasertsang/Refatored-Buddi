Directory Structure from a User's Point of View

There are a few directories used for Buddi, for various purposes.  The exact
locations will differ by platform, but the purposes are consistent.  These
are listed below:



Program Folder
This is where the main Buddi application can be located.  It is generally
encoureaged to put this in the correct location for your OS, but it is not
required to do so.  Below are suggested locations by platform:
	Windows: C:\Program Files\Buddi\Buddi.exe
	OS X: /Applications/Buddi.app
	Unix: /usr/bin/buddi, /usr/bin/Buddi.jar



User Folder:
This is where the user-specific files are stored.  This should be unique
to each user; if multiple user accounts are on the same machine, each will
have a different folder.  This differs by platform, and is selected 
automatically by Buddi:
	Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<User Name>\Application Data\Buddi\
	OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Buddi/
	Unix: ~/.buddi/

This contains the following files and folders:
	Buddi3_prefs.xml	(Buddi Preferences)
	Languages/		(Customized Languages)
	Plugins/		(Plugins)


Log Folder:
This is where the log file is saved.  This is OS specific, as follows:

	Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<User Name>\Application Data\Buddi\
	OS X: ~/Library/Logs/
	Unix: ~/.buddi/


Data Files:
Users can save data files wherever they wish.  Buddi does not keep track of
this, short of remember the last file which was opened.


Temporary Files:
When you create a report, the HTML is written to disk, in the user folder, 
in a sub folder called 'Reports'.  This folder and all files in it 
are deleted at program close.  Note that this is a potential security 
vulnerability: the HTML files are not encrytped, and are not deleted in a 
secure manner.  It is possible for an attacker with access to your machine to 
read the files, and it would be possible for an attacker with access to
an undelete utility to read the deleted HTML files.  I feel that, due to the
fact that the attacker must already have access to your machine, the risk is
minimal, but if you are very concerned about this, you may not wish to run
reports.
